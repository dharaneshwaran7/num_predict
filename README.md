# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN
An interactive application that recognizes handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the MNIST dataset.

# Video Demonstration
Check out the video demonstration to see the application in action:


# Project Overview
This project showcases a neural network application that predicts handwritten digits drawn on a canvas.

# Features
Interactive Drawing Canvas: Draw digits using a mouse on a Tkinter-based GUI.
Real-time Prediction: Predicts the drawn digit upon clicking "Predict".
Model Training and Evaluation: Trained on the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

# Model Details
Architecture: CNN with three convolutional blocks, batch normalization, LeakyReLU activations, max pooling, and dense layers.
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
Training: 15 epochs with checkpoints every 5 epochs.
